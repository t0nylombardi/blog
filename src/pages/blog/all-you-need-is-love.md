My now wife aded me to make some vows for our wedding. I thought I would merge the two loves together and wrote this little code poem. The original was written in PHP.

```ruby
#all you need is love
require 'date'
require 'love'

on_this_day = DateTime.now

begin
  if have_and_hold(better,worse)
    love_and_cherish(richer,pooer)
    get_sickness(status)
    get_health(status)

    puts "I #{name}, do love you"
  else
    divorce
  end
end while death(status) != nil
```
