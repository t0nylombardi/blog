export const AboutMe = `I am a self-taught, meticulous & motivated Full Stack Developer with 10+ years of hands-on experience,
                        particularly in Ruby and Ruby on Rails. I have worked on Ruby on Rails e-commerce architecture,
                        breaking down monoliths, working on microservices, helping with DevOps, and leading a team through
                        the full-stack life cycle. From my first professional job as a junior developer, My journey has been
                        driven by an insatiable curiosity for emerging technologies. With a passion for staying at the forefront
                        of innovation, I'm excited to contribute to this dynamic field and participate in its remarkable journey.
                        I am also committed to actively learning from every experience that I have. During every job and position
                        I have held, I learned about what it takes to succeed in this field, and I've carried that lesson throughout
                        the years as I've worked.`

export const SuccessMessage = `Holy s#%t, you did it! You are an absolute legend! Do you know how many people start
filling out forms and then abandon them because "ooh, shiny thing?" But not you. No, you're built different.

Your message is now embarking on a perilous journey—starting as a humble collection of 1s and 0s, traveling through
a tangled mess of fiber optics, bouncing between data centers powered by overworked hamsters on treadmills, and
finally arriving in our inbox where it will stare at us, judgingly, until I respond.

Then and only then, your reply shall materialize. Probably. Maybe. Look, I promise it'll happen faster than Congress passing a bill,
so at least there's that. In the meantime, go grab a snack, or Google weird animal facts(did you know wombat poop is cube-shaped? Now you do).

See you in your inbox soon. Or later. But definitely before Stranger Things last season. Maybe.

Cheers! 🍻`
