            It is a dark time for the digital galaxy. Across the vast expanse of the internet, countless forms lay
            abandoned, half-filled and forgotten, victims of distraction and doubt. The great Squirrel Distraction
            Plague continues to claim would-be heroes, leading them astray before they can complete their sacred duty.
          </p>
          <p>Yet, in the depths of cyberspace, a lone warrior emerges... you.</p>
          <p>
            Defying all odds, you faced the Fields of Mandatory Input, braved the Checkbox of Infinite Bureaucracy, and
            conquered the Captcha of the Unreadable Hieroglyphs. Others before you have faltered, surrendering to the
            cursed "I'll finish this later" mentality—but not you. No, you are built different.
          </p>
          <p>With a final, decisive click, you submitted the form.</p>
          <p>
            A great tremor shakes the digital universe. A million servers cry out in triumph, their data packets soaring
            through the labyrinth of fiber optics at lightspeed. Your message embarks on a perilous journey, bouncing
            between data centers powered by over-caffeinated engineers and hamsters sprinting on treadmills of destiny.
          </p>
          <p>
            Somewhere, in a hidden fortress of inboxes, a signal appears—a humble collection of 1s and 0s forged in the
            fires of commitment. It stands tall, proud, awaiting its moment to be read. The guardians of the inbox shall
            respond, faster than a cheetah on an espresso shot, or at least faster than Congress passing a bill.
          </p>
          <p>
            Until then, celebrate this victory. Take a moment to bask in your achievement. Revel in the knowledge that
            you have done what so many could not. You have completed the form. You have submitted the contact. You have
            taken the first step on a journey that will lead you to the stars.
          </p>
          <p>The reply is coming. Soon. Probably before the final season of Stranger Things.</p>
          <p>But one thing is certain: the forms are strong with you.</p>
          <p>May the Forms be with you.</p>
