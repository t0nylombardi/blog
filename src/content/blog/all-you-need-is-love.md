So, picture this: there I am, standing at the altar, nerves kicking in like a freight train, and my beautiful, amazing, now-wife asks me to drop some vows. Now, most guys would go for the standard "I promise to love you forever" spiel, but not me. Oh no, I had to bring a little flair to the table.

I whipped out my laptop, fired up some Ruy (yeah, I know, not exactly Shakespeare, but hey, it's my thing), and penned a code poem that merged my two loves: her and, well, coding.

It went a little something like this:

```ruby
# all you need is love
require 'date'
require 'love'

on_this_day = DateTime.now

begin
  if have_and_hold(better,worse)
    love_and_cherish(richer,pooer)
    get_sickness(status)
    get_health(status)

    puts "I #{name}, do love you"
  else
    divorce
  end
end while death(status) != nil
```

And let me tell you, the look on her face when I dropped that poetic PHP bombshell? Priceless. That's just how I roll, folks. Mixing romance with a dash of geekiness, because why the heck not?
