## Searching in Rails

Alright, we're going to dive into the thrilling world of a search feature. Now, let me set the stage here. Picture yourself cruising through a bustling web app, looking for that one needle in a haystack of information. You know what I'm talking about - whether it's finding the perfect pair of shoes or hunting down that elusive meme you saw last week, search functionality is your trusty sidekick in this digital adventure.

So, how do we bring this magical search feature to life in a Rails app? Well, buckle up, because we're about to embark on a journey that'll have you feeling like a modern-day Sherlock Holmes. We're gonna talk about the nitty-gritty of building a search feature in Rails, from the ground up. We'll cover everything from the basics of setting up a search method to more advanced features like searching across multiple tables and handling search parameters. By the time we're done, you'll be ready to unleash your inner detective and build a search feature that'll have users feeling like they've got the world at their fingertips.

## Implementing a Basic Search Feature

Let's talk about the search method in the controller. This is where the real magic happens. We're gonna whip up a nifty little search method that'll make your app feel like it's got its own personal detective on the case. We are going to use the all mighty `scaffold` generator to whip up our search feature. When we talk about Rails scaffold, we're basically talking about the holy grail of automatic file generation. We're talking controllers, views, models, routes, and migrations - the whole shebang.

Now, to get that ball rolling and scaffold your post, all you gotta do is fire off this command:

```bash
rails g scaffold post title description:text
```

And now it's time to bring it all together with a little thing called migration.

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

## Building the Search Form

Once that's done, you're at the main part of the tutorial. So, let's add the form in the `app/views/posts/index.html.erb` file. This is where the magic happens. We're going to sprinkle a little HTML and tailwind magic to make that search bar pop like a fireworks display. And when users type in their queries, they'll be whisked away to a search page that's as sleek and stylish as a red carpet premiere.

note: I put a lot of the tailwind css inside 'application.css' so it doesn't look like a mess in this blog.

```erb
<%= form_with url: posts_path, method: "get", class: "mt-8" do |f| %>
  <label for="search" class="search-label">Post</label>
  <div class="relative">
    <div class="search-icon">
      <svg class="w-6 h-6 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400" aria-hidden="true" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 20 20">
          <path stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="m19 19-4-4m0-7A7 7 0 1 1 1 8a7 7 0 0 1 14 0Z"/>
      </svg>
    </div>

    <div data-controller="address">
      <%= f.text_field :post,
                       id: :post,
                       placeholder: "Search Post",
                       class: "search-input",
                       required: true %>

      <%= f.hidden_field :search %>
    </div>
    <button id="submit" type="submit" class="search-btn">Search</button>
  </div>
<% end %>
```

## Implementing the Search Route

Now, let's talk about the search route in `routes.rb`. Think of this as laying down the tracks for your search feature to zoom through. With just a few lines of code, you'll be paving the way for users to find exactly what they're looking for in no time.

Let's add that search route in `routes.rb`. Think of this as laying down the tracks for your search feature to zoom through. With just a few lines of code, you'll be paving the way for users to find exactly what they're looking for in no time.

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :posts do
    collection do
      get :search
    end
  end
end
```

We're using the `collection` method here to add a new route that doesn't require an ID. This is perfect for our search feature, because we don't need to worry about specific post IDs when we're searching for something. We just want to cast a wide net and find all the posts that match the user's query.

## Implementing the Search Method

Now, let's talk about the search method in the controller. This is where the real magic happens. We're gonna whip up a nifty little search method that'll make your app feel like it's got its own personal detective on the case.

```ruby
def search
  if params[:search].present?
    @posts = Post.where("title LIKE ?", "%#{params[:search].downcase}%")
  else
    @posts = Post.all
  end

  render turbo_stream:
    turbo_stream.update('posts',
                         partial: 'posts',
                         locals: { posts: @posts })
end
```

Alright, folks, let's break it down like that rusty ole beater in your garage.

- First up, we've got `params[:search]` - that's like your backstage pass from the search bar to the main event. It's passing along whatever you type in that search bar, so make it count!

- Second `.downcase`. This bad boy's like your personal stylist, making sure all your letters are dressed in lowercase threads. Because let's face it, who needs uppercase drama when you're just trying to find that perfect meme?

- Third, pay attention, 'cause we're getting into the heavy stuff. When I say `Post` with a capital P, I mean the Posts table. That's where all the magic happens, folks.

- Fourth, let's not forget about our good friend, the `%` sign. Stick it at the beginning, and you're opening the floodgates to all the posts that end with whatever letter you throw in there. Toss it at the end, and you're diving headfirst into a pool of posts that start with that same letter. It's like magic, but with more databases.

- Fifth, onto the real MVP - `.where()`. This little powerhouse is our ticket to filtering out all the noise and honing in on exactly what we're looking for. We're talking about searching through columns like a pro, zeroing in on that golden nugget of information.

- And last but not least, we've got the big guns - `LIKE`. When I say `LIKE` in all caps, I mean business. It's like the matchmaker of the digital world, trying to find that perfect match between what you're searching for and what's hiding in the depths of your database. So when you see `LIKE`, you know it's game on, baby!


## Showing the Search Results

Now, let's talk about the search results in the view. This is where the magic happens. We're going to add some  HTML and tailwind magic to make those search results look a liitle more impressive.

```erb
<% if @posts.present? %>
  <div class="mt-8">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white dark:text-gray-100">Posts</h2>
    <div class="mt-4">
      <% @posts.each do |post| %>
        <div class="flex items">
          <div class="flex-1">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white dark:text-gray-100"><%= post.title %></h3>
            <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-500"><%= post.body %></p>
          </div>
        </div>
      <% end %>
    </div>
  </div>
<% end %>
```

We add a conditional statement to check if the `@posts` variable is present. If it is, we loop through each post and display the title and body.


## Updating the Posts Partial with Turbo Streams

turbo_stream is a Rails feature that allows you to update parts of a page without a full page reload. It's like having a little magic wand that lets you sprinkle some fairy dust on your app and make things happen in real time. And when you toss in the `turbo_stream.update` method, you're basically telling your app, "Hey, buddy, when someone hits that submit button, let's fire up that search method, pronto!"

What we are going to do is wrap the posts in a turbo_stream tag and update the posts partial with the new posts. This will allow us to update the posts without a full page reload.

```erb
<% if @posts.present? %>
  <div class="mt-8">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white dark:text-gray-100">Posts</h2>
    <div class="mt-4">
      <%= turbo_frame_tag "posts" do %>
        <% @posts.each do |post| %>
          <div class="flex items">
            <div class="flex-1">
              <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white dark:text-gray-100"><%= post.title %></h3>
              <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-500"><%= post.body %></p>
            </div>
          </div>
        <% end %>
      <% end %>
    </div>
  </div>
<% end %>
```

## Adding some data to the database

Now, let's add some data to the database. We're going to use the file `db/seeds.rb` to add some data to the database. This will give us some data to search through. Note we are going to use a gem called [faker](https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker) to generate some fake data.

```ruby
(1.)

Post.create(title: "The Best Post Ever", body: "This is the best post ever.")
